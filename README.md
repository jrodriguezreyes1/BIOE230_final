# Simulation for slime mold growing in response to food sources
This GitHub repository contains the scripts necessary to simulate slime mold moving in response to food by using an Active Brownian Particle model to simulate their search and introducing a chemoattractant force.

## Getting Started
The following packages need to be installed
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from numpy.random import random as rand
from scipy import stats
import math
from matplotlib import colors

## Utilizing the script
The simulations are run using a single markdown file. The markdown file is segmented into multiple different sections, with each section achieving a different goal. 
### Before you begin:
Make sure all mentioned packages are installed. Run the first code chunk to load all packages.
