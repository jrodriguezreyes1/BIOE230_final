# Simulation for slime mold growing in response to food sources
This GitHub repository contains the scripts necessary to simulate slime mold moving in response to food by using an Active Brownian Particle model to simulate their search and introducing a chemoattractant force.

## Getting Started
The following packages were used when running the code:
numpy version 1.20.1
matplotlib 3.3.4
scipy 1.6.2
math 

### Before you begin:
Make sure all mentioned packages are installed. Run the first code chunk to load all packages.

## Utilizing the script
The simulations are run using a single markdown file. The markdown file is segmented into multiple different sections, with each section achieving a different goal. 

### Objective 1: Model random walkers trajectories that move in response to a single chemoattractant
Add explanation here

### Objective 2: Model random walkers trajectories that move in response to chemoattractants scattered along a straight line
Add explanation here

### Objective 3: Build random walkers simultaneously to later enable attraction and repulsion towards other walkers as they move
